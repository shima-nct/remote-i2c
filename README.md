# Remote I2C

A SMBus class-compatible TCP proxy allowing you to host or connect to a Remote I2C
session with minimal effort.

My use case for writing this module is to allow me to work with I2C on a Raspberry Pi
that is on my network, without having to install anything that takes up too much memory
or processing power. I serve this thin SMBus server module on the Pi, then I can develop
as I please on my computer and interact with the I2C bus as if it was on my own machine.



# Important Notes

This module was developed:
* quickly
* without tests
* for the purpose of development

It is NOT:
* a replacement for an actual local I2C connection (*particularly* for real-time comms)
* guaranteed to be free of bugs
* suitable for production use (unless you're happy to take your chances)



# Install

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install remote-i2c
```



# Example

## On the I2C Host (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

1. Ensure that I2C is enabled! (```sudo raspi-config```)
1. Ensure that the user you're operating under has permission to access the I2C hardware! (e.g., part of the i2c group)
1. Run the remote-i2c module directly with the python interpreter from the command line:
    ```bash
    python3 -m remote_i2c
    ```
1. Alternatively, run the module from a python script:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    # Import the RemoteI2CServer class
    from remote_i2c import RemoteI2CServer

    # Create the server (see docstring for additional args)
    server = RemoteI2CServer()

    # Start the server (blocks forever!)
    server.serve()
    ```


## On the I2C Client (e.g., Desktop/Laptop)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Import the RemoteI2CClient class
from remote_i2c import RemoteI2CClient

# Connect to the I2C Host (see docstring for additional args)
remote_i2c_host = '192.168.1.2'
bus = RemoteI2CClient(remote_i2c_host)
bus.connect()

# Perform I2C operations as you normally would with SMBus2
addr = 0x67
reg = 0xf2
value = bus.read_byte_data(addr, reg)
bus.write_byte_data(addr, reg, value + 1 % 0xff)

# Disconnect when you're done, if you feel the need
bus.disconnect()
```
